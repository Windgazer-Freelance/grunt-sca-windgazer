# grunt-sca-windgazer

This is an attempt to pull in any static code analysis tools I use into a single config
that I can easily install via npm dependency-management.

## Goal

Single line installation using npm.

```
npm i grunt-sca-windgazer -D
```

## Dependencies

Since grunt can't handle distributed configuration out of the box, you'll need to install
something to handle that.

```
npm i load-grunt-configs -D
```
